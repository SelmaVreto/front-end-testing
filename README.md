1. Introduction
1.1. About the Project
The name of the project undergoing testing is CineStar Cinemas. It is the website of one of the  
leading cinema chains in the region. I will test and focus only on the page created for BiH.
The site is great, that is, there are many different testing options. There is detailed information about 
CineStar including movie schedule, benefits, services, loyalty programs, subscriptions. In addition, it 
is very functional, easy to use, which is the goal for easier buying or reservation of tickets.
Its link to homepage: https://www.blitz-cinestar-bh.ba/.


I will work on testing technique in which Graphical User Interface (GUI), functionality and usability 
of web applications are tested, that is front-end testing.
The goal of this Front-end testing is testing overall or as much as possible functionalities to ensure to 
have an insight into their accuracy. 


2. Test Plan
2.1. Scope
What this test documentation will contain are:
• test scenarios: different use cases that an ordinary customer might encounter using the website. Also 
used as a classification name for test cases.
• test cases: a detailed tabular description of all test cases performed, along with pre-condition(s),
steps, inputs, expected and actual results, and their final status.
• test executions: screenshots of all written tests.
The first cinema in Bosnia and Herzegovina was opened by this company in 2012. So that the website 
has been upgraded for a long time and is very extensive, I will try to cover all the essential 
functionalities, but not all.
As I said, the test plan will attempt to cover all basic functionalities, starting from the homepage.
Then, movie schedule functionalities, the process of buying or booking a ticket, seats. Moreover, 
additional aspects, such as log in/registration and the register and unregister for periodic notifications 
form will be tested, as well.
The test plan will not cover the testing of static resources, such as images and element texts, except 
in the areas where they prove that a desired functionality has triggered. The test plan will also not 
cover the actual order payment process or seat reservations, because it is an actual process that would 
harm the company or the user.

2.2. Testing Environment and Tools
Front-end tests of this web application will be conducted via the Selenium framework for Java, and 
contained within JUnit test cases. The tests will be written and run in Eclipse Java IDE 2021-09 
(4.21.0).
The web driver will use the Google Chrome executable.


3. Test Execution
3.1. Test Scenario: The homepage
Description: Users should be able to quickly scan the home page for the most critical features. In 
this scenario we will test these features!
